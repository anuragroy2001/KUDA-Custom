To form a "less-than" sign ("<") with the rope to describe the relationship between 1 and 2, we need to position the rope in a way that it forms an angle pointing to the left.

Here is the Python function to specify the final positions of the keypoints on the rope:

```python
def keypoint_specification():
    p8 = [0, -8, 0] # Move P8 slightly up
    p9 = [0, 8, 0]   # Move P9 slightly down
    p10 = [-8, 0, 0]  # Move P10 to the left
    
    return p8, p9, p10
```

This will place the keypoints in an angle forming a "less-than" sign ("<") between the numbers 1 and 2.
