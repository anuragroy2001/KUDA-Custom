To make the inequality "23 > 19" true, we need to form a greater-than sign (">") with the rope. We position the rope in a way that it forms an angle pointing to the right.

Here is the Python function to specify the final positions of the keypoints on the rope:

```python
def keypoint_specification():
    p4 = [-10, 10, 0]  # Move P4 to the top-left
    p5 = [-10, -10, 0]  # Move P5 to the bottom-left
    
    return p4, p5
```

This will place the keypoints in an angle forming a "greater-than" sign (">") between the numbers 23 and 19.
