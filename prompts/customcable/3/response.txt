To straighten the rope, we need to pull the two ends of the rope (P1 and P2) farther apart.

Here is the Python function to specify the final positions of the keypoints:

```python
def keypoint_specification():
    p1 = [20, 0, 0]   # Assuming P1 is 20 cm to the right of the center
    p2 = [-20, 0, 0]  # Assuming P2 is 20 cm to the left of the center
    
    return p1, p2
```

This will place the keypoints in a straight line along the x-axis, effectively straightening the rope.
