To make the cable look like a smile, we need to bring up the extreme ends of the cable and bring down the center of the cable to form a "U" like shape.

Here is the Python function to specify the final positions of the keypoints on the cable:

```python
def keypoint_specification():
    p15 = [12, 6, 0]  # Move P15 to the top-right
    p27 = [-12, 6, 0]  # Move P27 to the top-left
    p11 = [ 2.5, -1, 0 ]  # Move P11 to the bottom 
    p18 = [ -2.5, -1, 0 ]  # Move P18 to the bottom
    
    return p15, p27, p11, p18
```

This will place the keypoints in a "U" shape. The keypoints P15 and P27 are the extreme ends of the cable and therefore it is moved up, the keypoints P11 and P18 are closer to center and therefore it is moved down.
